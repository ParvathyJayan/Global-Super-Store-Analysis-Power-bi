# Global Super Store Sales Analysis
The Global Superstore Sales Analysis repository showcases a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that provides valuable insights into sales performance. This project is designed to present key information and trends to stakeholders, enabling informed decision-making.

## Data Cleaning
Before diving into the analysis, basic data cleaning steps were performed to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting the data appropriately for analysis.

## Key Features
✅Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
The dashboard prominently displays essential metrics such as total sales, total profit, total units sold, total number of products, total number of customers, and total orders. These KPIs provide a snapshot of the company's sales performance.

✅Doughnut Charts:
The dashboard includes four interactive doughnut charts that offer insights into different aspects of sales. These charts depict the distribution of orders by ship mode, sales by category, top 5 states by sales, and top 5 cities by sales. This information helps identify trends, preferences, and opportunities for targeted strategies.

✅Map Chart:
A map chart is incorporated to provide a geographic perspective on sales. It visually represents sales data across different regions, allowing stakeholders to identify regional strengths and opportunities for expansion.
